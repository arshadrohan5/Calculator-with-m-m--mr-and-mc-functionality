# Calculator-with-m-m--mr-and-mc-functionality
A Calculator with basic arithmetic operations along with number's base conversion. It also features memory base operations such as m+ (adding an operand to existing operand in memory), m- (subtracting an operand to existing operand in memory), mr (reading an operand stored in the memory), and mc (clearing the contents of the memory to 0).
This program uses a 16x2 LCD, 5x4 keypad and a TM4C123GXL board.
For interfacing the LCD and Keypad to the TM4C123GXL board, please refer to the comments in start of the 'project.c' file.
You can perform basic arithmetic and number's base conversion along with the mentioned memory operations.
Refer to the Youtube video to watch the working project.
